## Processing shader library

This is a first attempt to create a library from GLSL Shaders by genekogan (check his repository here
https://github.com/genekogan/Processing-Shader-Examples)

I added simple methods to implement fast GLSL filters and texture generators, to enhance the possibilities of the Processing enviromnment.

This is his original description:

This is a collection of GLSL shaders being run inside Processing. Some of them are generic ones (brightness/saturation/contrast filters, blur, edge detection, etc) and others are more experimental. A number of them are modifications of exmaples taken from GLSL Heroku.

In the Processing sketches, some shader parameters are routed to the position of the mouse, so as you move the mouse around inside the canvas, various properties of the shader graphics will change.
