# Forked Libraries for Processing

An archive of [Processing](https://processing.org) Libraries on GitHub, with one library stored in each git branch of this single repository.

-  Select a library with the branches menu.
-  Submit a library with a GitHub issue.

> Forked Libraries for Processing is part of the [Archive for Processing](https://github.com/archive-for-processing/) project.


## How it works

This repo does not fork libraries -- they *are* forks. Instead, this repo forks the single [original template](https://github.com/processing/processing-library-template) that they all descend from, and then archives a copy of each unique library in its own named branch. 

-  `master` is a fork of [Processing Library Template for Eclipse](https://github.com/processing/processing-library-template)
-  `default` contains this README, and is displayed on GitHub.
-  any library that was GitHub-forked from that template repo (a "forked library") is archived in a named branch:
   -  `grafica`
   -  `keystoned`
   -  `proscene`
   -  et cetera


## Why branches

Why archive these repos in the branches of a single repo? Why not a set of forks?

The GitHub library template was created long prior to the GitHub implementation of a "template" repo copying feature.

https://github.com/processing/processing-library-template

As a result, most GitHub repos for Processing libraries are "forks."

A limitation of GitHub is that one account cannot create multiple fork repos from the same tree. For this reason, the Archive for Processing GitHub account may make a fork of the template...

https://github.com/archive-for-processing/processing-library-template

...but after doing so, it can no longer fork any of the ~60 original libraries which are also forks of that same template. Only one may be chosen.

> The new template system works around this problem, but comes with its own limitations. Most older libraries have not been miigrated to template-copies -- they are still forks -- and the process of migrating a github fork to a template copy is poorly documented.

These are also forks of the template which do not customize the repo name, but are nontheless distinct projects:

-  https://github.com/grant-oakley/processing-library-template (ColorMapPer)
-  https://github.com/kang36897/processing-library-template (firework)

And these are also a set of parallel forks -- all called "planetarium", and possibly related (although not seen by GitHub as a subtree).
