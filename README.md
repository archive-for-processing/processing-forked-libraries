RiftIt
======

A Processing Library for Oculus Rift


RiftIt provides Oculus Rift support for Processing. 
With RiftIt you can directly dive into any P3D sketch and move around in the scene with the provided FreeFly WASD mode
by just adding some lines. Right now it's a pre-alpha (pre-xmas) release.

Thanks to Rickard Eden and his jmonkeyengine-oculus-rift project as well as michael.of.05, 
whose shader contributions are included in this lib.
