# Patterning for Processing

A Processing Library that wraps a copy of [Patterning](https://github.com/interstar/Patterning-Core), the Clojure pattern generation library as a library suitable for using from a Processing sketch.

## Intro
This project is forked from [the Processing library template](https://github.com/processing/processing-library-template) for Eclipse. See the instructions in that project for more information about how to use it.

You will need to add two jar files to the path for your project in Eclipse : 
 * The Processing core.jar as described in that project
 * The Patterning.jar which can be found either on [Clojars](https://clojars.org/com.alchemyislands/patterning) or in the lib directory of this git download.
 

This project can be compiled to make a Processing Library. You can also use it as an example for including the Patterning library jar in your own Java projects.
