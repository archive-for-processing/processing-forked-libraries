# LazerWrap

LazerWrap is a Processing library for creating visual modules to use with any syphon compatible VJ software, such as VDMX. It provides Classes to interface with KORG NanoKontrol MIDI controllers, as well as a Beat Manager, which allows your code to subscribe to beat events.

This library was written mainly for my personal use, so you probably won't find it that useful except if you're using exactly the same setup as me. But hey, it's a big world, so you never know who might find this useful!

Thanks!
